Its clinical and genetic diagnosis is crucial for cardiac management and genetic counselling. Seven LMNA mutations have been previously reported to be responsible for LGMD1B.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the neurological and cardiologic features of 14 patients belonging to 8 families in whom we identified 6 different LMNA mutations, 4 of them having never been reported. Results. Eleven patients had an LGMD1B phenotype with scapulohumeral and pelvic-femoral involvement. Thirteen patients had cardiac disease associating conduction defects (12 patients) or arrhythmias (9 patients). Seven patients needed cardiac device (pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator) and two had heart transplantation.\nCONCLUSION: This study allowed us to specify the clinical characteristics of this entity and to outline the first phenotype/genotype relations resulting from these observations.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(LMMA, REG, Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1b)"}

Primarily, mutations in LMNA have been associated to the autosomal forms of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, a rare slowly progressive humero-peroneal muscular dystrophy accompanied by early contractures and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. LMNA mutations have been reported to be responsible for up to 10 distinct phenotypes that affect specifically either the skeletal and/or cardiac muscle, the adipose tissue, the peripheral nervous tissue, the bone tissue or more recently premature ageing. So far more than 180 different LMNA mutations have been identified in 903 individuals. The first studies of phenotype/genotype relationships revealed no dear relation between the phenotype and the type and/or the localization of the mutation, except perhaps for the globular tail domain of lamins A/C. Studies of the consequences of LMNA mutations in the skin cultured fibroblasts from the patients reveal abnormal nuclei in variable proportions, with dysmorphic nuclei exhibiting abnormal patterns of expression of B-type lamins and emerin. Finally, the development of KO and KI LMNA mice, will certainly give further insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with LMNA mutations.

It has been shown that the disease is caused by cathepsin C gene (CTSC) mutation leading to the deficiency of cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This study demonstrates the clinical manifestations and CTSC mutational and enzymatic activity analyses in a 5-year-old Thai male PLS patient and his parents.\nMETHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained for genomic DNA isolation. All exons of the CTSC gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. Mutations were identified by DNA sequencing. Verification of the mutation was performed by digestion of PCR products by restriction endonucleases. The cathepsin C enzymatic activity was determined using the synthetic substrate glycyl- L-arginine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin.\nRESULTS: The patient demonstrated classical characteristics of PLS, including hyperkeratotic skin lesions. By the age of 5, all of his primary teeth were extracted due to severe periodontal infection. The parents had no physical abnormalities. The periodontal examination revealed localized mild periodontal destruction. Sequence analysis showed a nucleotide change at position 90 from C >A (c.90C >A) which resulted in a change from cysteine residue to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 30 in the exon 1. The HpyCH4V digestion revealed that the patient was homozygous, whereas both the father and mother were heterozygous carriers of this mutation. The cathepsin C activity was reduced in the patient's mother, and the activity in the patient was almost completely lost.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate a CTSC gene mutation in a Thai family with PLS. The identified mutation is novel and potentially leads to the drastic reduction of the cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This suggests that the mutation is pathogenetic, causing the PLS. Mutational analysis in more members of the family is warranted to identify whether the mutation is inherited from a common ancestor.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(CTSC, LOF, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome)"}

The disease is caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene (also known as FALDH and ALDH10) on chromosome 17p11.2 that encodes fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes derived from lipid metabolism.

Missense mutations comprise the most abundant class (38%) and expression studies indicate that most of these result in a profound reduction in enzyme activity. Deletions account for about 25% of the mutations and range from single nucleotides to entire exons. Twelve splice-site mutations have been demonstrated to cause aberrant splicing in cultured fibroblasts.

Children affected with this disease tend to develop normally for the first 5 years of life. However, once disease onset occurs, they decline rapidly and die in their late 20s to early 30s. Though this represents the typical disease course, the onset and severity of disease symptoms can vary. This variability is presumed to be the result of both differences in the causative genetic mutation in the CLN3 gene as well as environmental influences.

In a subset of affected individuals and animals, mutations in the EDA gene (formerly EDI), coding for ectodysplasin, have been found to cause this phenotype. Ectodysplasin is a homotrimeric transmembrane protein with an extracellular TNF-like domain, which has been shown to be involved in the morphogenesis of hair follicles and tooth buds during fetal development.

The mean maximum serum CK level at any age of the patients was 5,829 +/- 4,273 IU/l (range 1,289-12,566 IU/l ) for MM and 3,787 +/- 2,493 IU/l (627-10,000 IU/l) for LGMD2B: in both disorders, the serum CK level fell in proportion to the duration of the illness. We have identified four common four mutations (C1939G, G3370T, 3746delG, and 4870delT) in Japanese patients with MM, accounting for 48 percent of all MM mutations in this population. Two of the four mutations (G3370T, and 4870delT) accounted for 52 percent of the mutations in LGMD2B patients, while the 3746delG mutation was not found in patients with LGMD2B. The G3370T mutation may be associated with a milder form of MM and LGMD2B.

It is genetically heterogeneous, showing linkage to three X chromosomal loci. CORDX1 is caused by mutations in the RPGR gene (Xp21.1), CORDX2 is located on Xq27.2-28, and we recently localised CORDX3 to Xp11.4-q13.1. We aimed to identify the causative gene behind the CORDX3 phenotype.\nMETHODS: All 48 exons of the CACNA1F gene were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing. RNA from cultured lymphoblasts and peripheral blood activated T lymphocytes was analysed by RT-PCR and sequencing.\nRESULTS: A novel CACNA1F mutation, IVS28-1 GCGTC>TGG, in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 was identified. Messenger RNA studies indicated that the identified mutation leads to altered splicing of the CACNA1F transcript. Aberrant splice variants are predicted to result in premature termination and deletions of the encoded protein, Ca(v)1.4 alpha1 subunit.\nCONCLUSION: CACNA1F mutations cause the retinal disorder, incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2), although mutations have also been detected in patients with divergent diagnoses. Our results indicate that yet another phenotype, CORDX3, is caused by a mutation in CACNA1F. Clinically, CORDX3 shares some features with CSNB2 but is distinguishable from CSNB2 in that it is progressive, can begin in adulthood, has no nystagmus or hyperopic refraction, has only low grade astigmatism, and in dark adaptation lacks cone threshold and has small or no elevation of rod threshold. Considering all features, CORDX3 is more similar to other X chromosomal cone-rod dystrophies than to CSNB2.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(CACNA1F, REG, X linked cone-rod dystrophy), (CACNA1F, REG, congenital stationary night blindness), (RPGR, REG, X linked cone-rod dystrophy)"}

In addition to SLAM, SAP associates with several other cell-surface receptors including 2B4 (CD244), Ly9 (CD229), CD84 and NTB-A. SAP contains a single src-homology-2 domain and acts as an intracellular adaptor protein by recruiting the protein tyrosine kinase FynT to the cytoplasmic domains of some of these receptors, which results in the initiation of specific downstream signal transduction pathways. XLP is likely to result from perturbed signalling through one or more of these SAP-associating receptors. In this study, we identified missense (Y54C, I84T and F87S) and insertion (fs82 --> X103) mutations in four different kindreds affected by XLP. Each mutation dramatically reduced the half-life of SAP, thus diminishing its expression in primary lymphocytes as well as in transfected cell lines. Interestingly, although the Y54C and F87S mutations compromised the ability of SAP to associate with different receptors, the I84T mutation had no effect on the ability of SAP to bind SLAM, CD84 or 2B4. However, signalling downstream of SLAM was reduced in the presence of SAP bearing the I84T mutation. These findings indicate that, irrespective of the type of mutation, signalling through SAP-associating receptors in XLP can be impaired by reducing the expression of SAP, the ability of SAP to bind surface receptors and/or its ability to activate signal transduction downstream of the SLAM-SAP complex.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(SH2D1A, LOF, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease)"}

Minimum criteria for inclusion in the adRP cohort included either evidence of at least three generations of affected individuals or two generations with evidence of male-to-male transmission. Probands from each family were screened for mutations in 13 genes known to cause adRP: CA4, CRX, FSCN2, IMPDH1, NRL, PRPF3 (RP18), PRPF8 (RP13), PRPF31 (RP11), RDS, RHO, ROM1, RP1, and RP9. Families without mutations in autosomal genes and in which an X-linked mode of inheritance could not be excluded were tested for mutations in ORF 15 of X-linked RPGR. Potentially pathogenic variants were evaluated based on a variety of genetic and computational criteria, to confirm or exclude pathogenicity.\nRESULTS: A total of 82 distinct, rare (nonpolymorphic) variants were detected among the genes tested. Of these, 57 are clearly pathogenic based on multiple criteria, 10 are probably pathogenic, and 15 are probably benign. In the cohort of 200 families, 94 (47%) have one of the clearly pathogenic variants and 10 (5%) have one of the probably pathogenic variants. One family (0.5%) has digenic RDS-ROM1 mutations. Two families (1%) have a pathogenic RPGR mutation, indicating that families with apparent autosomal transmission of RP may actually have X-linked genetic disease. Thus, 107 families (53.5%) have mutations in known genes, leaving 93 whose underlying cause is still unknown.\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, the known adRP genes account for retinal disease in approximately half of the families in this survey, mostly Americans of European origin.

LS is the most common hereditary form of CRC, accounting for approximately 1% of all CRC. Since the first account of mutations in MSH2 causing this cancer susceptibility syndrome in 1993, mutations in three additional MMR genes, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2, have been shown to cause LS. More than 1,500 different variants have been identified in these four genes and approximately 80% of the alterations have been identified in MLH1 and MSH2. There have been a few previous attempts to systematically record MMR variants associated with LS patients; however, they were not complete nor were they continuously updated. Thus, it was our goal to generate and maintain a comprehensive catalogue of MMR variants from genes known to be mutated in LS (http://www.med.mun.ca/MMRvariants; last accessed 8 February 2007).

It is normally present in two forms, a full-length form B and an N-terminal truncated form A with still unknown function. Mutations in the AR gene cause androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), which is divided into subgroups according to the degree of undermasculinization. Patients with completely female external genitalia are classified as complete AIS (CAIS). However, a recent study has shown that some CAIS patients have signs of internal male genital differentiation due to missense mutations that show some degree of residual function.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the expression of the different forms of the AR in two CAIS patients in relation to the development of male internal genital structures. One patient had a mutation (L7fsX33) that affects only the full-length AR-B form of the AR, whereas the other had a nonsense mutation (Q733X) affecting both isoforms.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We thoroughly analysed internal genitalia at surgery and by histological examination. No signs of Wolffian duct (WD) development were present in any of the patients. Western blotting of proteins from gonadal and genital skin fibroblasts was performed with AR antibodies directed against different AR epitopes. The N-terminally truncated A form was expressed in normal amounts in the patient with the L7fsX33 mutation while no AR was detected in the other patient.\nCONCLUSION: The presence of the AR-A form does not seem to be sufficient for WD maintenance and differentiation.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(AR, REG, androgen insensitivity syndrome)"}

The increased accumulation of DSBs in WS cells is reduced in the presence of anti-oxidative agents, suggesting that enhanced oxidative stress in WS cells is involved in accelerated accumulation of DSBs.

Introduction of regular substitution with FXIII concentrate prevented spontaneous bleeding in seven patients.

The purpose of this study was, by examining the electrophysiological responses of the retina, to evaluate the capacity of recovery of the whole retinal area and different cell types induced by extremely prolonged dark adaptation (DA) in BD disease and to gain further understanding of the pathogenesis of BD. Six young patients underwent bilateral full-field ERGs after 24 h of DA in one eye and standard DA in the fellow eye. The results were also compared with the effect of prolonged DA (10 h), previously studied in the same patients. After extremely prolonged DA (24 h) the rod b-wave and the mixed rod-cone a-wave responses reached normal though delayed amplitudes. An increase, up to normal level, in the oscillatory response was found. There was no obvious recovery of the cone response. We conclude that in young BD patients during extremely prolonged DA there is a significant additional capacity of recovery of rod function and also significant gain of activity in the inner retinal layer.

Mutations are mainly truncating mutations or deletions, missense mutations having been reported in few cases. An important phenotypic variability is observed among gene carriers. To assess whether the phenotypic variability of neurofibromatosis 2 could be linked to genotype, clinical data of 154 patients whose NF2 germline alteration had been identified in our laboratory have been collected.\nMETHODS: A retrospective questionnaire was sent to the physicians in charge of these patients. Statistical analyses regarding genotypic and phenotypic data were performed by comparisons of average values and correlation tests.\nRESULTS: In French patients, type of mutation was correlated neither with patients' sex, nor with disease occurrence mode (de novo or inherited mutation). Disease associated with missense mutations occurred later, with a less severe symptomatology. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were more frequently affected with meningiomas and spinal tumours, in addition to VIII nerve schwannomas, an observation that underlies the genetic determination of the number and type of NF2-related tumours.\nCONCLUSION: Results from the literature as well as from our study tend to show that only few correlations exist between genotype and phenotype in the NF2 disease. It also recognizes that missense mutations have a lower level of evolution, severity and mortality risk. Nonsense and frameshift mutations seem to be associated with a higher number of meningiomas and spinal tumours. Therefore, NF2 gene screening keeps its indications in both typical and moderate forms of the disease. Mutations are responsible of 80 p.cent of typical forms; in moderate forms, identification of a missense mutation seems linked to a lower disease evolution.

Among these diseases, hereditary periodic fevers (HPFs) are Mendelian disorders associated with sequence variations in very few genes; these variations are mostly missense mutations whose deleterious effect, which is particularly difficult to assess, is often questionable. The growing number of identified sporadic cases of periodic fever syndrome, together with the lack of discriminatory clinical criteria, has greatly hampered the identification of new disease-causing genes, a step that is, however, essential for appropriate management of these disorders.

As shown by means of functional studies, these two NALP12 mutations have a deleterious effect on NF-kappaB signaling. Overall, these data identify a group of HPFs defined by molecular defects in NALP12, opening up new ways to manage these disorders.

We investigated 6 different PRPF31 mutations, represented by single-base substitutions or microdeletions, in cell lines derived from 9 patients with dominant retinitis pigmentosa.

Mutations in alphaB-crystallin, desmin, myotilin, Zasp, or filamin-C can cause MFMs and were detected in 32 of 85 patients of the Mayo MFM cohort. Bag3, another Z-disk-associated protein, has antiapoptotic properties, and its targeted deletion in mice causes fulminant myopathy with early lethality. We therefore searched for mutations in BAG3 in 53 unrelated MFM patients.\nMETHODS: We searched for mutations in BAG3 by direct sequencing. We analyzed structural changes in muscle by histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy, examined mobility of the mutant Bag3 by nondenaturing electrophoresis, and searched for abnormal aggregation of the mutant protein in COS-7 (SV-40 transformed monkey kidney fibroblast-7) cells.\nRESULTS: We identified a heterozygous p.Pro209Leu mutation in three patients.

Two probands with ADO-II were diagnosed based on their bone characteristics on X-rays and their laboratory results. All 25 exons of the CLCN7 gene, including the exon-intron boundaries, were sequenced. We found in family 1 that the proband (a 32-year-old woman) was heterozygous for a CLCN7 mutation. The nonsynonymous mutation consisted of a heterozygous C/T transition at codon 2327 in exon 24, which resulted in an arginine (CGG)-to tryptophan (TGG) substitution at position 767 (R767W).

Neuromyotonic discharges were not influenced by general anesthesia and disappeared with curare administration. They persisted after complete motor nerve section, terminating only with Wallerian degeneration. These results demonstrate that perlecan deficiency in SJS provokes a neuromyotonic syndrome. The findings further suggest a distal axonal localization of the generator of neuromyotonic discharges. SJS should now be considered as an inherited disorder with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(HSPG2, LOF, Schwartz-Jampel syndrome)"}

To assess the protective as well as the modulating affect of MEFV mutation carriage on various inflammatory disease states, we sought to define the frequency of MEFV mutations in Israeli Jewish individuals of various ethnicities, including those with low frequency of FMF, which were not in the focus of our attention hitherto. A total of 163 adults of Bucharian, Turkish, Georgian, Yemenite and Bulgarian origin comprised the study group. The prevalence of the most frequent MEFV mutations in the Israeli Jewish population, namely: M694V, V726A and E148Q, was assessed. The association of mutation carriage with a personal history of FMF-like phenomena, as well as various inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases, was evaluated. A high MEFV mutation frequency was found among Jews of Bucharian, Georgian and Bulgarian origin (20%), whereas intermediate and low rates were detected in Jews of Turkish and Yemenite extraction (14 and 8%, respectively). FMF-like manifestations and related diseases were observed more often in MEFV mutation carriers than in their counterparts. MEFV mutation frequency, directly assessed by DNA analysis, exceeds the rate calculated from disease prevalence in Israeli Jewish individuals originated from ethnicities with a low prevalence of FMF.

Selected confocal images of corneal layers were evaluated qualitatively for shape and degree of light reflection of deposits.\nRESULTS: Novel mutations in the UBIAD1 gene (Y174C, K181R, and N233H) were identified. Additionally, cosegregation of the mutation (Y174C) and SCCD was confirmed in 1 pedigree, indicating that the mutation of the UBIAD1 gene is causative for SCCD. The 3 mutations were absent in all 200 control chromosomes. In vivo laser confocal microscopy demonstrated subepithelial highly reflective crystals in 4 cases; the shapes of the crystals were needle-shaped (3 cases) or rectangular (1 case). A phenotype and genotype correlation was demonstrated in 1 pedigree, and phenotypic heterogeneity (SCCD with or without crystals caused by a same mutation of Y174C in the UBIAD1 gene) also was demonstrated in 1 pedigree.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nonsynonymous novel mutations in the UBIAD1 gene were detected in 3 unrelated Japanese pedigrees with SCCD, confirming the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder. In vivo laser confocal microscopy is capable of identifying characteristic corneal microstructural changes related to genetically mapped SCCD with high resolution, and phenotypic heterogeneity was presented.

ATGL specifically hydrolyzes the first fatty acid from triacylglycerols (TG) and CGI-58/ABHD5 stimulates ATGL activity by a currently unknown mechanism. Mutations in both the ATGL and the CGI-58 genes are associated with systemic TG accumulation, yet the resulting clinical manifestations are not identical. Patients with defective ATGL function suffer from more severe myopathy (NLSDM) than patients with defective CGI-58 function. On the other hand, CGI-58 mutations are always associated with ichthyosis (NLSDI), which was not observed in patients with defective ATGL function.

Cases of dominant inheritance and phenotype-genotype heterogeneity have been reported; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not currently understood. The FMF protein named pyrin or marenostrin (P/M) is thought to be involved in regulating innate immunity but its function remains subject to controversy. Recent studies postulate that a defect in MEFV expression regulation may play a role in FMF physiopathology. Our group, along with others, has identified several alternatively spliced MEFV transcripts in leukocytes. Since alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathways are usually coupled in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that NMD could contribute to the regulation of the MEFV gene. To address this issue, we examined the effect of indirect and direct inhibition of NMD on expression of the MEFV transcripts in THP1, monocyte and neutrophil cells. We showed that MEFV is the first auto-inflammatory gene regulated by NMD in both a cell- and transcript-specific manner. These results and preliminary western-blot analyses suggest the possible translation of alternatively spliced MEFV transcripts into several P/M variants according to cell type and inflammatory state. Our results introduce the novel hypothesis that variation of NMD efficiency could play an important role in FMF physiopathology as a potent phenotypic modifier.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(MEFV, REG, familial Mediterranean feve)"}

Here we established the molecular basis of 42 cases of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II and attempted to define a genotype-phenotype relationship.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: SEC23B gene sequencing analysis was performed to assess the diversity and incidence of each mutation in 42 patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (25 described exclusively in this work), from the Italian and the French Registries, and the relationship of these mutations with the clinical presentation. To this purpose, we divided the patients into two groups: (i) patients with two missense mutations and (ii) patients with one nonsense and one missense mutation.\nRESULTS: We found 22 mutations of uneven frequency, including seven novel mutations. Compound heterozygosity for a missense and a nonsense mutation tended to produce a more severe clinical presentation, a lower reticulocyte count, a higher serum ferritin level, and, in some cases, more pronounced transfusion needs, than homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two missense mutations. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two nonsense mutations was never found.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study allowed us to determine the most frequent mutations in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II.

Eye morphogenesis in humans involves a molecular genetic cascade in which a number of developmental genes interact in a highly organized process during the embryonic period to produce functional ocular structures. Among these genes, paired box gene 6 (PAX6) has an essential role as it encodes a phylogenetically conserved transcription factor almost universally employed for eye formation in animals with bilateral symmetry, despite widely different embryological origins. To direct eye development, PAX6 regulates the tissue-specific expression of diverse molecules, hormones, and structural proteins. In humans, PAX6 is located in chromosome 11p13, and its mutations lead to a variety of hereditary ocular malformations of the anterior and posterior segment, among which aniridia and most probably foveal hypoplasia are the major signs. Aniridia occurs due to decreased dosage of the PAX6 gene and exists in both sporadic and familial forms. The mutations are scattered throughout the gene and the vast majority of those reported so far are nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, or splicing errors that are predicted to cause pre-mature truncation of the PAX6 protein, causing haploinsufficiency.

LMNA mutations have been reported to be responsible for up to 10 distinct phenotypes that affect specifically either the skeletal and/or cardiac muscle, the adipose tissue, the peripheral nervous tissue, the bone tissue or more recently premature ageing. So far more than 180 different LMNA mutations have been identified in 903 individuals.

It has been shown that the disease is caused by cathepsin C gene (CTSC) mutation leading to the deficiency of cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This study demonstrates the clinical manifestations and CTSC mutational and enzymatic activity analyses in a 5-year-old Thai male PLS patient and his parents.\nMETHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained for genomic DNA isolation. All exons of the CTSC gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. Mutations were identified by DNA sequencing. Verification of the mutation was performed by digestion of PCR products by restriction endonucleases. The cathepsin C enzymatic activity was determined using the synthetic substrate glycyl- L-arginine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin.\nRESULTS: The patient demonstrated classical characteristics of PLS, including hyperkeratotic skin lesions. By the age of 5, all of his primary teeth were extracted due to severe periodontal infection. The parents had no physical abnormalities. The periodontal examination revealed localized mild periodontal destruction. Sequence analysis showed a nucleotide change at position 90 from C >A (c.90C >A) which resulted in a change from cysteine residue to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 30 in the exon 1. The HpyCH4V digestion revealed that the patient was homozygous, whereas both the father and mother were heterozygous carriers of this mutation. The cathepsin C activity was reduced in the patient's mother, and the activity in the patient was almost completely lost.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate a CTSC gene mutation in a Thai family with PLS. The identified mutation is novel and potentially leads to the drastic reduction of the cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This suggests that the mutation is pathogenetic, causing the PLS.

A muscle biopsy specimen was obtained and studied by immunohistochemistry. Genetic analysis was performed using single-stranded conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing of genomic DNA.\nRESULTS: All the patients presented the R1905X mutation in the DYSF gene in homozygosity, and the haplotype analysis at the DYSF locus revealed that it was a novel and founder mutation. A C-to-T transition at nucleotide position 6086 changes an arginine into a stop codon, leading to premature termination of translation. This mutation was expressed as 3 different clinical phenotypes (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, Miyoshi distal myopathy, and distal anterior dysferlinopathy), but only 1 phenotype was found in the same family.\nCONCLUSIONS: The new R1905X DYSF founder mutation produced the 3 possible dysferlinopathy phenotypes without intrafamilial heterogeneity.

The 23 common mutations of beta thalassaemia found in Chinese populations were detected by means of a reverse dot blot method. Direct DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified complete beta globin gene was carried out to identify the novel mutation.

It is unknown whether the risk of ICP is increased in CF carriers who have one CF-causing mutation plus one normal allele. In this study, 52 sporadic cases of ICP were ascertained through the European Registry of Hereditary Pancreatitis and Familial Pancreatic Cancer. Individuals with pathogenic cationic trypsinogen mutations were excluded. DNA was comprehensively tested for CFTR mutations using a robotically enhanced, multiplexed, and highly redundant form of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by DNA sequencing. Fifteen subjects had a total of 18 pathogenic CFTR alleles. Eight subjects had common CF-causing mutations. This group included seven CF carriers in whom the second CFTR allele was normal (4.3 times the expected frequency, P=0.0002). Three subjects had compound heterozygotes genotypes containing two pathogenic alleles (31 times the expected frequency, P<0.0001). A variant allele of uncertain significance (p.R75Q) was detected in eight of the 52 ICP subjects and at a similar frequency (13/96) in random donors. ICP differs from other established CFTR-related conditions in that ICP risk is increased in CF carriers who have one documented normal CFTR allele.

In a subset of affected individuals and animals, mutations in the EDA gene (formerly EDI), coding for ectodysplasin, have been found to cause this phenotype. Ectodysplasin is a homotrimeric transmembrane protein with an extracellular TNF-like domain, which has been shown to be involved in the morphogenesis of hair follicles and tooth buds during fetal development. Some human XHED patients also have concurrent immunodeficiency, due to mutations in the NF-kappaB essential modulator protein (IKBKG; formerly NEMO), which is also encoded on the X chromosome. In a breeding colony of dogs with XHED, immune system defects had been suspected because of frequent pulmonary infections and unexpected deaths resulting from pneumonia. To determine if defects in EDA or IKBKG cause XHED in the dogs, linkage analysis and sequencing experiments were performed. A polymorphic marker near the canine EDA gene showed significant linkage to XHED. The canine EDA gene was sequenced and a nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the splice acceptor site of intron 8 was detected in affected dogs. In the presence of the A residue, a cryptic acceptor site within exon 9 is used, leading to a frame shift and use of a premature stop codon that truncates the translation of both isoforms, EDA-A1 and EDA-A2, resulting in the absence of the TNF-like homology domain, the receptor-binding site of ectodysplasin.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(EDA, LOF, X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia)"}

Three novel mutations, T177I, S108R and E474K were also identified in the Lebanese group.

Homozygotes for M694V and M694I were still in excess in the Lebanese group of patients, even after consanguinous homozygotes were removed, or population structure was considered. This excess is therefore neither due to consanguinity nor to subgroups in the Lebanese population, but rather to more remote consanguinity or to a selection bias favoring the census of these genotypes. The fact that FMF female patients were less censed than male patients may be due to the greater resistance of females to pain and to the possibility of confusing abdominal and gynecological pain.

CORDX1 is caused by mutations in the RPGR gene (Xp21.1), CORDX2 is located on Xq27.2-28, and we recently localised CORDX3 to Xp11.4-q13.1. We aimed to identify the causative gene behind the CORDX3 phenotype.\nMETHODS: All 48 exons of the CACNA1F gene were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing. RNA from cultured lymphoblasts and peripheral blood activated T lymphocytes was analysed by RT-PCR and sequencing.\nRESULTS: A novel CACNA1F mutation, IVS28-1 GCGTC>TGG, in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 was identified. Messenger RNA studies indicated that the identified mutation leads to altered splicing of the CACNA1F transcript.

In addition to SLAM, SAP associates with several other cell-surface receptors including 2B4 (CD244), Ly9 (CD229), CD84 and NTB-A. SAP contains a single src-homology-2 domain and acts as an intracellular adaptor protein by recruiting the protein tyrosine kinase FynT to the cytoplasmic domains of some of these receptors, which results in the initiation of specific downstream signal transduction pathways. XLP is likely to result from perturbed signalling through one or more of these SAP-associating receptors. In this study, we identified missense (Y54C, I84T and F87S) and insertion (fs82 --> X103) mutations in four different kindreds affected by XLP. Each mutation dramatically reduced the half-life of SAP, thus diminishing its expression in primary lymphocytes as well as in transfected cell lines. Interestingly, although the Y54C and F87S mutations compromised the ability of SAP to associate with different receptors, the I84T mutation had no effect on the ability of SAP to bind SLAM, CD84 or 2B4. However, signalling downstream of SLAM was reduced in the presence of SAP bearing the I84T mutation. These findings indicate that, irrespective of the type of mutation, signalling through SAP-associating receptors in XLP can be impaired by reducing the expression of SAP, the ability of SAP to bind surface receptors and/or its ability to activate signal transduction downstream of the SLAM-SAP complex.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(SH2D1A, LOF, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease)"}

Minimum criteria for inclusion in the adRP cohort included either evidence of at least three generations of affected individuals or two generations with evidence of male-to-male transmission. Probands from each family were screened for mutations in 13 genes known to cause adRP: CA4, CRX, FSCN2, IMPDH1, NRL, PRPF3 (RP18), PRPF8 (RP13), PRPF31 (RP11), RDS, RHO, ROM1, RP1, and RP9. Families without mutations in autosomal genes and in which an X-linked mode of inheritance could not be excluded were tested for mutations in ORF 15 of X-linked RPGR. Potentially pathogenic variants were evaluated based on a variety of genetic and computational criteria, to confirm or exclude pathogenicity.\nRESULTS: A total of 82 distinct, rare (nonpolymorphic) variants were detected among the genes tested. Of these, 57 are clearly pathogenic based on multiple criteria, 10 are probably pathogenic, and 15 are probably benign. In the cohort of 200 families, 94 (47%) have one of the clearly pathogenic variants and 10 (5%) have one of the probably pathogenic variants. One family (0.5%) has digenic RDS-ROM1 mutations. Two families (1%) have a pathogenic RPGR mutation, indicating that families with apparent autosomal transmission of RP may actually have X-linked genetic disease. Thus, 107 families (53.5%) have mutations in known genes, leaving 93 whose underlying cause is still unknown.\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, the known adRP genes account for retinal disease in approximately half of the families in this survey, mostly Americans of European origin. Among the adRP genes, IMPDH1, PRPF8, PRPF31, RDS, RHO, and RP1 each accounts for more than 2% of the total; CRX, PRPF3, and RPGR each accounts for roughly 1%.

It is normally present in two forms, a full-length form B and an N-terminal truncated form A with still unknown function. Mutations in the AR gene cause androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), which is divided into subgroups according to the degree of undermasculinization. Patients with completely female external genitalia are classified as complete AIS (CAIS). However, a recent study has shown that some CAIS patients have signs of internal male genital differentiation due to missense mutations that show some degree of residual function.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the expression of the different forms of the AR in two CAIS patients in relation to the development of male internal genital structures. One patient had a mutation (L7fsX33) that affects only the full-length AR-B form of the AR, whereas the other had a nonsense mutation (Q733X) affecting both isoforms.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We thoroughly analysed internal genitalia at surgery and by histological examination. No signs of Wolffian duct (WD) development were present in any of the patients. Western blotting of proteins from gonadal and genital skin fibroblasts was performed with AR antibodies directed against different AR epitopes. The N-terminally truncated A form was expressed in normal amounts in the patient with the L7fsX33 mutation while no AR was detected in the other patient.\nCONCLUSION: The presence of the AR-A form does not seem to be sufficient for WD maintenance and differentiation.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(AR, REG, androgen insensitivity syndrome)"}

Patients Choreoacanthocytosis was identified in 2 Mexican mestizo sisters with healthy consanguineous parents. Clinical manifestations began at different ages.\nRESULTS: The onset of signs and symptoms of CHAC in the proband was at age 32 years and was characterized by balancing problems followed by chorea, compulsive lip and tongue biting with buccolingual self-mutilation, dysarthria, dysphagia, and weight loss. The first clinical manifestations in the proband's sister occurred at age 45 years and included multiple motor and verbal tics, with coprolalia, followed by lip and tongue biting, self-mutilation, and chorea. The clinical findings in both sisters were remarkable for acanthocytosis that developed late, when neurologic changes were already evident. Mutation screening of the VPS13A gene revealed homozygosity for the frameshift mutation c.3556_3557dupAC in exon 33. Currently, the proband's sister, in whom neurologic defects developed 13 years after onset of CHAC in the proband, is the least affected.\nCONCLUSIONS: The same mutation of the VPS13A gene can be expressed differently in the same family. This observation confirms the notion that there is considerable heterogeneity in the clinical manifestation of CHAC.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(VPS13A, REG, Choreoacanthocytosis)"}

Mutations are mainly truncating mutations or deletions, missense mutations having been reported in few cases. An important phenotypic variability is observed among gene carriers. To assess whether the phenotypic variability of neurofibromatosis 2 could be linked to genotype, clinical data of 154 patients whose NF2 germline alteration had been identified in our laboratory have been collected.\nMETHODS: A retrospective questionnaire was sent to the physicians in charge of these patients. Statistical analyses regarding genotypic and phenotypic data were performed by comparisons of average values and correlation tests.\nRESULTS: In French patients, type of mutation was correlated neither with patients' sex, nor with disease occurrence mode (de novo or inherited mutation). Disease associated with missense mutations occurred later, with a less severe symptomatology. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were more frequently affected with meningiomas and spinal tumours, in addition to VIII nerve schwannomas, an observation that underlies the genetic determination of the number and type of NF2-related tumours.\nCONCLUSION: Results from the literature as well as from our study tend to show that only few correlations exist between genotype and phenotype in the NF2 disease. It also recognizes that missense mutations have a lower level of evolution, severity and mortality risk. Nonsense and frameshift mutations seem to be associated with a higher number of meningiomas and spinal tumours. Therefore, NF2 gene screening keeps its indications in both typical and moderate forms of the disease. Mutations are responsible of 80 p.cent of typical forms; in moderate forms, identification of a missense mutation seems linked to a lower disease evolution. In any case, assessment and supervision should be identical. Finally, in a small number of cases, the NF2 gene appears to be implicated in clinical forms different from those defined by NIH and it might be of interest to enlarge the clinical features suggestive of the disease.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(NF2, REG, neurofibromatosis type 2), (nan, nan, nan)"}

Current advances in the function of NALPs support the recently proposed model of a disease continuum bridging autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Among these diseases, hereditary periodic fevers (HPFs) are Mendelian disorders associated with sequence variations in very few genes; these variations are mostly missense mutations whose deleterious effect, which is particularly difficult to assess, is often questionable. The growing number of identified sporadic cases of periodic fever syndrome, together with the lack of discriminatory clinical criteria, has greatly hampered the identification of new disease-causing genes, a step that is, however, essential for appropriate management of these disorders. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified nonambiguous mutations in NALP12 (i.e., nonsense and splice site) in two families with periodic fever syndromes. As shown by means of functional studies, these two NALP12 mutations have a deleterious effect on NF-kappaB signaling. Overall, these data identify a group of HPFs defined by molecular defects in NALP12, opening up new ways to manage these disorders. The identification of these first NALP12 mutations in patients with autoinflammatory disorder also clearly demonstrates the crucial role of NALP12 in inflammatory signaling pathways, thereby assigning a precise function to this particular member of an emerging family of proteins whose putative biological properties are currently inferred essentially through in vitro means.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(NALP12, REG, hereditary periodic fever syndromes)"}

Disease-associated ABCA4 alleles were identified in 20 of 64 patients with arCD or arCRD. In four of 64 patients (6%) only one mutant ABCA4 allele was detected and in 16 patients (25%), mutations on both ABCA4 alleles were identified.

Most of these mutations are characterized by DNA changes that lead to premature termination codons. We investigated 6 different PRPF31 mutations, represented by single-base substitutions or microdeletions, in cell lines derived from 9 patients with dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Five of these mutations lead to premature termination codons, and 1 leads to the skipping of exon 2. Allele-specific measurement of PRPF31 transcripts revealed a strong reduction in the expression of mutant alleles. As a consequence, total PRPF31 protein abundance was decreased, and no truncated proteins were detected. Subnuclear localization of the full-length PRPF31 that was present remained unaffected. Blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay significantly restored the amount of mutant PRPF31 mRNA but did not restore the synthesis of mutant proteins, even in conjunction with inhibitors of protein degradation pathways. Our results indicate that most PRPF31 mutations ultimately result in null alleles through the activation of surveillance mechanisms that inactivate mutant mRNA and, possibly, proteins.

Therefore, cortisol will bind mineralocorticoid receptor. The human HSD11B2 gene maps to chromosome 16q22 and consists of five exons encoding a protein of 405 amino acids. We present here clinical and molecular studies on a Brazilian boy who was born pre-term after an oligodramnious pregnancy. He was diagnosed as having AME at the age of 26 months.

Recent studies have reported loss-of-function mutations in the chloride channel 7 (CLCN7) gene as a cause of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II (ADO-II). The identification of gene mutations in Chinese with ADO has not been reported previously. In this study, we identified mutations of the CLCN7 gene in two unrelated Chinese families with ADO-II. Two probands with ADO-II were diagnosed based on their bone characteristics on X-rays and their laboratory results. All 25 exons of the CLCN7 gene, including the exon-intron boundaries, were sequenced. We found in family 1 that the proband (a 32-year-old woman) was heterozygous for a CLCN7 mutation. The nonsynonymous mutation consisted of a heterozygous C/T transition at codon 2327 in exon 24, which resulted in an arginine (CGG)-to tryptophan (TGG) substitution at position 767 (R767W). The same heterozygous mutation (C/T) was determined in her father and son, who were asymptomatic with normal skeleton radiography. In family 2, we found that the proband (a 17-year-old boy) carried a novel frameshift mutation (Glu798FS) resulting from a G insertion between codon 60 and codon 61 in exon 25. The heterozygous -/G insertion is predicted to elongate the peptide of CLCN7 by 120 amino acids after position 797 amino acids. Similarly, some individuals of this family carried the same heterozygous mutation, but they are all asymptomatic. Furthermore, the R767W and Glu798FS mutations were not found in 100 unrelated controls.

It is due to loss-of-function hypomorphic mutations in the HSPG2 gene that encodes for perlecan, a proteoglycan secreted into the basement membrane. The origin of muscle stiffness in SJS is debated. To resolve this issue, we performed an electrophysiological investigation of an SJS mouse model with a missense mutation in the HSPG2 gene. Compound muscle action potential amplitudes, distal motor latencies, repetitive nerve stimulation tests, and sensory nerve conduction velocities of SJS mice were normal. On electromyography (EMG), neuromyotonic discharges, that is, bursts of motor unit action potentials firing at high rates (120-300 HZ), were constantly observed in SJS mice in all muscles, except in the diaphragm. Neuromyotonic discharges were not influenced by general anesthesia and disappeared with curare administration. They persisted after complete motor nerve section, terminating only with Wallerian degeneration. These results demonstrate that perlecan deficiency in SJS provokes a neuromyotonic syndrome. The findings further suggest a distal axonal localization of the generator of neuromyotonic discharges.

Cases of dominant inheritance and phenotype-genotype heterogeneity have been reported; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not currently understood. The FMF protein named pyrin or marenostrin (P/M) is thought to be involved in regulating innate immunity but its function remains subject to controversy. Recent studies postulate that a defect in MEFV expression regulation may play a role in FMF physiopathology. Our group, along with others, has identified several alternatively spliced MEFV transcripts in leukocytes. Since alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathways are usually coupled in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that NMD could contribute to the regulation of the MEFV gene. To address this issue, we examined the effect of indirect and direct inhibition of NMD on expression of the MEFV transcripts in THP1, monocyte and neutrophil cells. We showed that MEFV is the first auto-inflammatory gene regulated by NMD in both a cell- and transcript-specific manner. These results and preliminary western-blot analyses suggest the possible translation of alternatively spliced MEFV transcripts into several P/M variants according to cell type and inflammatory state. Our results introduce the novel hypothesis that variation of NMD efficiency could play an important role in FMF physiopathology as a potent phenotypic modifier.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(MEFV, REG, familial Mediterranean feve)"}

Recently it was shown that the vast majority of patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II carry mutations in the SEC23B gene. Here we established the molecular basis of 42 cases of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II and attempted to define a genotype-phenotype relationship.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: SEC23B gene sequencing analysis was performed to assess the diversity and incidence of each mutation in 42 patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (25 described exclusively in this work), from the Italian and the French Registries, and the relationship of these mutations with the clinical presentation. To this purpose, we divided the patients into two groups: (i) patients with two missense mutations and (ii) patients with one nonsense and one missense mutation.\nRESULTS: We found 22 mutations of uneven frequency, including seven novel mutations. Compound heterozygosity for a missense and a nonsense mutation tended to produce a more severe clinical presentation, a lower reticulocyte count, a higher serum ferritin level, and, in some cases, more pronounced transfusion needs, than homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two missense mutations. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two nonsense mutations was never found.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study allowed us to determine the most frequent mutations in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II. Correlations between the mutations and various biological parameters suggested that the association of one missense mutation and one nonsense mutation was significantly more deleterious that the association of two missense mutations. However, there was an overlap between the two categories.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(SEC23B, REG, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II)"}

Eye morphogenesis in humans involves a molecular genetic cascade in which a number of developmental genes interact in a highly organized process during the embryonic period to produce functional ocular structures. Among these genes, paired box gene 6 (PAX6) has an essential role as it encodes a phylogenetically conserved transcription factor almost universally employed for eye formation in animals with bilateral symmetry, despite widely different embryological origins. To direct eye development, PAX6 regulates the tissue-specific expression of diverse molecules, hormones, and structural proteins. In humans, PAX6 is located in chromosome 11p13, and its mutations lead to a variety of hereditary ocular malformations of the anterior and posterior segment, among which aniridia and most probably foveal hypoplasia are the major signs. Aniridia occurs due to decreased dosage of the PAX6 gene and exists in both sporadic and familial forms. The mutations are scattered throughout the gene and the vast majority of those reported so far are nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, or splicing errors that are predicted to cause pre-mature truncation of the PAX6 protein, causing haploinsufficiency.

Individuals with biotinidase deficiency can develop neurological and cutaneous symptoms if they are not treated with biotin. Biotinidase deficiency screening has been incorporated into essentially all newborn screening programs in the United States and in many countries. We now report 140 known mutations in the biotinidase gene (BTD) that cause biotinidase deficiency. All types of mutations have been found to cause biotinidase deficiency. Variants have been identified throughout the coding sequence. Essentially all the variants result in enzymatic activities with less than 10% of mean normal enzyme activity (profound biotinidase deficiency) with the exception of the c.1330G>C (p.D444H) mutation, which results in an enzyme having 50% of mean normal serum activity. The putative three-dimensional structure of biotinidase has been predicted by homology to that of nitrilases/amidases. The effect of the various missense mutations can be predicted to affect various important sites within the structure of the enzyme. This compilation of variants causing biotinidase deficiency will be useful to clinical laboratories that are performing mutation analysis for confirmational testing when the enzymatic results are equivocal for children identified through newborn screening.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(BTD, LOF, biotinidase deficiency)"}

The rate of deletion mutant occurred in Exon 45-54 was 71.9% (281/391) in all gene deletion patients; meanwhile, the rate of gene duplication occurred in Exon 1-40 was 82.9% (63/76) in all gene duplication ones. In all the patients with gene deletion and duplication, the rate of DMD and IMD was 90.6% (423/467), and BMD, 9.4% (44/467). This indicates that the main reason of duchenne muscular dystrophy is dystrophin gene deletion mutation, which would occur in any gene unevenly with hot spots of mutation. The location and fragment length of gene deletion and duplication cannot decide the severity of clinical symptoms directly.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(dystrophin gene, REG, duchenne muscular dystrophy)"}

Studies in mouse models of DS suggest that cognitive deficits in the adult are associated with deficits in synaptic learning and memory mechanisms, but it is unclear whether alterations in the early wiring and refinement of neuronal circuits contribute to these deficits. Here, we show that early developmental refinement of visual circuits is perturbed in mouse models of Down syndrome. Specifically, we find excessive eye-specific segregation of retinal axons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Indeed, the degree of refinement scales with defects in the \"Down syndrome critical region\" (DSCR) in a dose-dependent manner. We further identify Dscam (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule), a gene within the DSCR, as a regulator of eye-specific segregation of retinogeniculate projections. Although Dscam is not the sole gene in the DSCR contributing to enhanced refinement in trisomy, Dscam dosage clearly regulates cell spacing and dendritic fasciculation in a specific class of retinal ganglion cells. Thus, altered developmental refinement of visual circuits that occurs before sensory experience is likely to contribute to visual impairment in individuals with Down syndrome.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(chromosome 21, REG, Down syndrome)"}

Functional assays were performed in HEK 293T cells stably expressing the proapoptotic protein ASC and procaspase 1, in order to determine the effects of normal and mutated NLRP12 proteins on speck formation, caspase 1 signaling, and NF-\u03baB activation.\nRESULTS: A heterozygous NLRP12 missense mutation involving a CpG site (c.1054C>T; p.Arg352Cys) was identified in exon 3, which encodes the nucleotide-binding site (NBS) of the protein, in 2 patients from different countries and carrying different NLRP12 haplotypes. The mutation, which does not alter the inhibitory effect of NLRP12 on NF-\u03baB activation, increases speck formation and activates caspase 1 signaling.

Consistent with our earlier report, sarcosine levels were significantly elevated in PCa urine sediments compared to controls, with a modest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71. In addition, the expression of sarcosine biosynthetic enzyme, glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), was elevated in PCa tissues, while sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH) and pipecolic acid oxidase (PIPOX), which metabolize sarcosine, were reduced in prostate tumors. Consistent with this, GNMT promoted the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by facilitating sarcosine production, while SARDH and PIPOX reduced the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by metabolizing sarcosine. Accordingly, addition of sarcosine, but not glycine or alanine, induced invasion and intravasation in an in vivo PCa model.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate predictive and prognostic significance of microtubule-associated protein Tau in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients treated with paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy. METHODS: 74 patients with EOC (stage I-IV) who underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by standard paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy were included in the retrospective analysis. Their formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were immunohistochemically stained for Tau protein, using semi-quantitative DAKO test. Tau expression was acknowledged as negative (0 and 1+) or positive (2+ and 3+). The correlation between Tau expression, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meyer estimator, long rank test, Mann Whitney test and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: 25.7% (19/74) and 74.3% (55/74) of the patients were classified as Tau-negative and Tau-positive, respectively. Median PFS was 28.7 months for Tau-negative group and 15.9 months for Tau-positive group (p = 0.0355).

CD44, an adhesion molecule that binds to the extracellular matrix, primarily to hyaluronan (HA), has been implicated in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. CD44 has also recently been recognized as a marker for stem cells of several types of cancer. However, the roles of CD44 in the development of bone metastasis are unclear. Here, we addressed this issue by using bone metastatic cancer cell lines, in which CD44 was stably knocked down. Tumor sphere formation and cell migration and invasion were significantly inhibited by CD44 knockdown. Furthermore, the downregulation of CD44 markedly suppressed tumorigenicity and bone metastases in nude mice. Of note, the number of osteoclasts decreased in the bone metastases. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of HA synthase 2 was downregulated in CD44-knockdown cells. The localization of HA in the bone metastatic tumors was also markedly reduced. We then examined the roles of CD44-HA interaction in bone metastasis using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an inhibitor of HA synthesis. 4-MU decreased tumor sphere and osteoclast-like cell formation in vitro. Moreover, 4-MU inhibited bone metastases in vivo with reduced number of osteoclasts. These results collectively suggest that CD44 expression in cancer cells promotes bone metastases by enhancing tumorigenicity, cell migration and invasion, and HA production.

Pathway disruption is regarded as imparting a BRCAness phenotype. We explored the molecular changes in HGSC arising in association with specific BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic or germline mutations and in those with BRCA1 DNA promoter methylation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We describe gene expression and copy number analysis of two large cohorts of HGSC in which both germline and somatic inactivation of HRR has been measured. RESULTS: BRCA1 disruptions were associated with the C2 (immunoreactive) molecular subtype of HGSC, characterized by intense intratumoral T-cell infiltration. We derived and validated a predictor of BRCA1 mutation or methylation status, but could not distinguish BRCA2 from wild-type tumors.

A detailed definition of the neuro-ophthalmologic spectrum of CADASIL might provide new insights in the pathophysiology of small-vessel diseases. Therefore, this study aims to precisely delineate the features and the prevalence of the visual system impairment in CADASIL. METHODS: A cohort of 34 genetically confirmed CADASIL patients was enrolled in an observational cross-sectional study. Subjects underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmological evaluation. Clinical features and common cardiovascular risk factors were also considered. Data were compared with those already reported in previous studies. RESULTS: Both afferent and efferent visual structures were commonly impaired in CADASIL patients. Retinal microvascular changes such as arteriolar narrowing and arteriovenous nicking, described in most patients and detected also in asymptomatic carriers, reflect the typical hemodynamic changes of CADASIL. However, less frequent findings, like early macular and lens changes, would indicate a possible further role played by susceptibility to premature aging and degeneration. Cotton wool spots and vessel occlusions were not common. Finally, eye movement abnormalities suggest that the brainstem is particularly vulnerable to damage in CADASIL.

PURPOSE: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare but potentially deadly tumor of the eye. Despite effective local therapies, recurrence and metastasis remain frequent. Once the tumor has metastasized, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor. To date, little is known of the genetic alterations in conjunctival melanomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted genetic analysis of 78 conjunctival melanomas, to our knowledge the largest cohort reported to date. An oncogene hotspot array was run on 38 samples, screening for a panel of known cancer-relevant mutations. Thirty tumors were analyzed for genome-wide copy number alterations (CNA) using array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Sanger sequencing of selected target mutations was conducted in all samples. RESULTS: BRAF mutations were identified in 23 of 78 (29%) tumors. NRAS mutations, previously not recognized as relevant in conjunctival melanoma, were detected in 14 of 78 (18%) tumors. We found CNAs affecting various chromosomes distributed across the genome in a pattern reminiscent of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma but differing markedly from uveal melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of NRAS or BRAF mutations in a mutually exclusive pattern in roughly half (47%) of conjunctival melanomas and the pattern of CNAs argue for conjunctival melanoma being closely related to cutaneous and mucosal melanoma but entirely distinct from uveal melanoma. Patients with metastatic conjunctival melanoma should be considered for therapeutic modalities available for metastatic cutaneous and mucosal melanoma including clinical trials of novel agents.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(BRAF, GOF, Conjunctivalmelanoma), (NRAS, GOF, Conjunctivalmelanoma)"}

Since dopamine deficiency has been found with cocaine addiction, our objective was to examine whether functional variants in the ankyrin repeat and kinase domain-containing 1 (ANKK1) and/or the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) genes interact with response to treatment with disulfiram. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cocaine and opioid codependent (DSM-IV) patients were stabilized on methadone and subsequently randomized into treatment groups - disulfiram (250 mg/day, N=31) or placebo (N=37). They were genotyped for ANKK1 (rs1800497) and DRD2 (rs2283265) polymorphisms, and the data were evaluated for an association between a cocaine-free state, as assessed by cocaine-free urine samples, and disulfiram treatment. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance corrected for population structure. RESULTS: Patients with CT or TT ANKK1 genotypes dropped from 80 to 52% cocaine-positive urines on disulfiram (N=13; P\ufffd\ufffd0.0001), whereas those on placebo (N=20) showed no treatment effect. Patients carrying the CC ANKK1 genotype showed no effect on treatment with disulfiram (N=18) or placebo (N=17). The GT/TT DRD2 genotype group showed a significant decrease in the number of cocaine-positive urine samples on disulfiram (N=9; 67-48%; P \ufffd\ufffd 0.0001), whereas the GG DRD2 genotype group showed only a marginal decrease (N=23; 84-63%; P=0.04). Genotype pattern analysis revealed that individuals carrying at least one minor allele in either gene responded better to disulfiram treatment (N=13; P \ufffd\ufffd 0.0001) compared with individuals carrying only the major alleles (N=17).

To evaluate the potential endophenotypes of panic disorder, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-revised (ASI-R), harm avoidance in the Temperament and Character Inventory (HA), and neuroticism in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (neuroticism) scales were administered. RESULTS: For 5-HTTLPR and HTR1A rs6295, there was no significant main effect of each genotype on panic disorder alone. However, the number of separation life events and their interaction with 5-HTTLPR showed a statistically significant effect on panic disorder.

VEXAS syndrome is characterized by a high mortality rate and significant clinical heterogeneity. We sought to determine independent predictors of survival in VEXAS and to understand the mechanistic basis for these factors. We analyzed 83 patients with somatic pathogenic variants in UBA1 at p.Met41 (p.Met41Leu/Thr/Val), the start codon for translation of the cytoplasmic isoform of UBA1 (UBA1b). Patients with the p.Met41Val genotype were most likely to have an undifferentiated inflammatory syndrome. Multivariate analysis showed ear chondritis was associated with increased survival, whereas transfusion dependence and the p.Met41Val variant were independently associated with decreased survival. Using in vitro models and patient-derived cells, we demonstrate that p.Met41Val variant supports less UBA1b translation than either p.Met41Leu or p.Met41Thr, providing a molecular rationale for decreased survival. In addition, we show that these 3 canonical VEXAS variants produce more UBA1b than any of the 6 other possible single-nucleotide variants within this codon. Finally, we report a patient, clinically diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome, with 2 novel mutations in UBA1 occurring in cis on the same allele. One mutation (c.121 A>T; p.Met41Leu) caused severely reduced translation of UBA1b in a reporter assay, but coexpression with the second mutation (c.119 G>C; p.Gly40Ala) rescued UBA1b levels to those of canonical mutations. We conclude that regulation of residual UBA1b translation is fundamental to the pathogenesis of VEXAS syndrome and contributes to disease prognosis.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(UBA1, LOF, VEXASsyndrome)"}

We demonstrate that both endogenous and transfected ataxin-1 localizes to sites of DNA damage, which is impaired by polyglutamine expansion.

Consistent with our earlier report, sarcosine levels were significantly elevated in PCa urine sediments compared to controls, with a modest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71. In addition, the expression of sarcosine biosynthetic enzyme, glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), was elevated in PCa tissues, while sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH) and pipecolic acid oxidase (PIPOX), which metabolize sarcosine, were reduced in prostate tumors. Consistent with this, GNMT promoted the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by facilitating sarcosine production, while SARDH and PIPOX reduced the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by metabolizing sarcosine. Accordingly, addition of sarcosine, but not glycine or alanine, induced invasion and intravasation in an in vivo PCa model. In contrast, GNMT knockdown or SARDH overexpression in PCa xenografts inhibited tumor growth.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate predictive and prognostic significance of microtubule-associated protein Tau in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients treated with paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy. METHODS: 74 patients with EOC (stage I-IV) who underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by standard paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy were included in the retrospective analysis. Their formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were immunohistochemically stained for Tau protein, using semi-quantitative DAKO test. Tau expression was acknowledged as negative (0 and 1+) or positive (2+ and 3+). The correlation between Tau expression, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meyer estimator, long rank test, Mann Whitney test and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: 25.7% (19/74) and 74.3% (55/74) of the patients were classified as Tau-negative and Tau-positive, respectively. Median PFS was 28.7 months for Tau-negative group and 15.9 months for Tau-positive group (p = 0.0355). In the univariate analysis 3-year OS in Tau-negative and Tau-positive groups was 80.2% and 52.4%, respectively (p = 0.0198). Low expression of protein Tau was associated with better OS, whereas an advanced stage at diagnosis, suboptimal surgery, serous histological type and resistance to first line chemotherapy were each correlated with worse OS (p <0,05). In multivariate analysis only resistance to first line chemotherapy remained significant (HR 22.59; 95% CI, 8.71-58.55; p <0.0001).

CD44, an adhesion molecule that binds to the extracellular matrix, primarily to hyaluronan (HA), has been implicated in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. CD44 has also recently been recognized as a marker for stem cells of several types of cancer. However, the roles of CD44 in the development of bone metastasis are unclear. Here, we addressed this issue by using bone metastatic cancer cell lines, in which CD44 was stably knocked down. Tumor sphere formation and cell migration and invasion were significantly inhibited by CD44 knockdown. Furthermore, the downregulation of CD44 markedly suppressed tumorigenicity and bone metastases in nude mice. Of note, the number of osteoclasts decreased in the bone metastases. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of HA synthase 2 was downregulated in CD44-knockdown cells. The localization of HA in the bone metastatic tumors was also markedly reduced. We then examined the roles of CD44-HA interaction in bone metastasis using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an inhibitor of HA synthesis. 4-MU decreased tumor sphere and osteoclast-like cell formation in vitro. Moreover, 4-MU inhibited bone metastases in vivo with reduced number of osteoclasts. These results collectively suggest that CD44 expression in cancer cells promotes bone metastases by enhancing tumorigenicity, cell migration and invasion, and HA production. Our results also suggest the possible involvement of CD44-expressing cancer stem cells in the development of bone metastases through interaction with HA. CD44-HA interaction could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention for bone metastases.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(CD44, GOF, Bonemetastasis)"}

PURPOSE: High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) accounts for the majority of epithelial ovarian cancer deaths. Genomic and functional data suggest that approximately half of unselected HGSC have disruption of the BRCA pathway and defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR). Pathway disruption is regarded as imparting a BRCAness phenotype. We explored the molecular changes in HGSC arising in association with specific BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic or germline mutations and in those with BRCA1 DNA promoter methylation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We describe gene expression and copy number analysis of two large cohorts of HGSC in which both germline and somatic inactivation of HRR has been measured. RESULTS: BRCA1 disruptions were associated with the C2 (immunoreactive) molecular subtype of HGSC, characterized by intense intratumoral T-cell infiltration. We derived and validated a predictor of BRCA1 mutation or methylation status, but could not distinguish BRCA2 from wild-type tumors. DNA copy number analysis showed that cases with BRCA1 mutation were significantly associated with amplification both at 8q24 (frequencies: BRCA1 tumors 50%, BRCA2 tumors 32%, and wild-type tumors 9%) and regions of the X-chromosome specifically dysregulated in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC; BRCA1 62%, BRCA2 34%, and wild-type 35%).

A detailed definition of the neuro-ophthalmologic spectrum of CADASIL might provide new insights in the pathophysiology of small-vessel diseases. Therefore, this study aims to precisely delineate the features and the prevalence of the visual system impairment in CADASIL. METHODS: A cohort of 34 genetically confirmed CADASIL patients was enrolled in an observational cross-sectional study. Subjects underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmological evaluation. Clinical features and common cardiovascular risk factors were also considered. Data were compared with those already reported in previous studies. RESULTS: Both afferent and efferent visual structures were commonly impaired in CADASIL patients. Retinal microvascular changes such as arteriolar narrowing and arteriovenous nicking, described in most patients and detected also in asymptomatic carriers, reflect the typical hemodynamic changes of CADASIL. However, less frequent findings, like early macular and lens changes, would indicate a possible further role played by susceptibility to premature aging and degeneration. Cotton wool spots and vessel occlusions were not common. Finally, eye movement abnormalities suggest that the brainstem is particularly vulnerable to damage in CADASIL.

To evaluate the potential endophenotypes of panic disorder, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-revised (ASI-R), harm avoidance in the Temperament and Character Inventory (HA), and neuroticism in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (neuroticism) scales were administered. RESULTS: For 5-HTTLPR and HTR1A rs6295, there was no significant main effect of each genotype on panic disorder alone. However, the number of separation life events and their interaction with 5-HTTLPR showed a statistically significant effect on panic disorder. In addition, the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and the number of separation life events significantly affected the HA for potential endophenotypes. CONCLUSION: This study could suggest the effect of the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and separation life events on panic disorder and its potential endophenotype.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(5-HTTLPR, COM, Panic disorder), (HTR1A rs6295, COM, Panic disorder)"}

Clinical, immunologic and radiographical examinations were performed, and 10 patients were empirically initiated on anticytokine therapy and monitored. Exome sequencing was used to identify a new pathogenic variant. Cytokine profiling, transcriptomics, immunoblotting and knock-in mice were used to assess the impact of ALPK1 mutations on protein function and immune signalling.\\n Results: The majority of the cohort carried the p.Thr237Met mutation but we also identified a new ROSAH-associated mutation, p.Tyr254Cys.Nearly all patients exhibited at least one feature consistent with inflammation including recurrent fever, headaches with meningeal enhancement and premature basal ganglia/brainstem mineralisation on MRI, deforming arthritis and AA amyloidosis.

We sought to determine independent predictors of survival in VEXAS and to understand the mechanistic basis for these factors. We analyzed 83 patients with somatic pathogenic variants in UBA1 at p.Met41 (p.Met41Leu/Thr/Val), the start codon for translation of the cytoplasmic isoform of UBA1 (UBA1b). Patients with the p.Met41Val genotype were most likely to have an undifferentiated inflammatory syndrome. Multivariate analysis showed ear chondritis was associated with increased survival, whereas transfusion dependence and the p.Met41Val variant were independently associated with decreased survival. Using in vitro models and patient-derived cells, we demonstrate that p.Met41Val variant supports less UBA1b translation than either p.Met41Leu or p.Met41Thr, providing a molecular rationale for decreased survival. In addition, we show that these 3 canonical VEXAS variants produce more UBA1b than any of the 6 other possible single-nucleotide variants within this codon. Finally, we report a patient, clinically diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome, with 2 novel mutations in UBA1 occurring in cis on the same allele.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate predictive and prognostic significance of microtubule-associated protein Tau in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients treated with paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy. METHODS: 74 patients with EOC (stage I-IV) who underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by standard paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy were included in the retrospective analysis. Their formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were immunohistochemically stained for Tau protein, using semi-quantitative DAKO test. Tau expression was acknowledged as negative (0 and 1+) or positive (2+ and 3+). The correlation between Tau expression, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meyer estimator, long rank test, Mann Whitney test and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: 25.7% (19/74) and 74.3% (55/74) of the patients were classified as Tau-negative and Tau-positive, respectively. Median PFS was 28.7 months for Tau-negative group and 15.9 months for Tau-positive group (p = 0.0355). In the univariate analysis 3-year OS in Tau-negative and Tau-positive groups was 80.2% and 52.4%, respectively (p = 0.0198). Low expression of protein Tau was associated with better OS, whereas an advanced stage at diagnosis, suboptimal surgery, serous histological type and resistance to first line chemotherapy were each correlated with worse OS (p <0,05). In multivariate analysis only resistance to first line chemotherapy remained significant (HR 22.59; 95% CI, 8.71-58.55; p <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Negative tau protein seems to be both good prognostic factor and a predictor of response to paclitaxel/platinum-based chemotherapy in EOC patients.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(TAU, LOF, epithelialovariancancer)"}

CD44, an adhesion molecule that binds to the extracellular matrix, primarily to hyaluronan (HA), has been implicated in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. CD44 has also recently been recognized as a marker for stem cells of several types of cancer. However, the roles of CD44 in the development of bone metastasis are unclear. Here, we addressed this issue by using bone metastatic cancer cell lines, in which CD44 was stably knocked down. Tumor sphere formation and cell migration and invasion were significantly inhibited by CD44 knockdown. Furthermore, the downregulation of CD44 markedly suppressed tumorigenicity and bone metastases in nude mice. Of note, the number of osteoclasts decreased in the bone metastases. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of HA synthase 2 was downregulated in CD44-knockdown cells. The localization of HA in the bone metastatic tumors was also markedly reduced. We then examined the roles of CD44-HA interaction in bone metastasis using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an inhibitor of HA synthesis. 4-MU decreased tumor sphere and osteoclast-like cell formation in vitro. Moreover, 4-MU inhibited bone metastases in vivo with reduced number of osteoclasts. These results collectively suggest that CD44 expression in cancer cells promotes bone metastases by enhancing tumorigenicity, cell migration and invasion, and HA production. Our results also suggest the possible involvement of CD44-expressing cancer stem cells in the development of bone metastases through interaction with HA. CD44-HA interaction could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention for bone metastases.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(CD44, GOF, Bonemetastasis)"}

PURPOSE: High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) accounts for the majority of epithelial ovarian cancer deaths. Genomic and functional data suggest that approximately half of unselected HGSC have disruption of the BRCA pathway and defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR). Pathway disruption is regarded as imparting a BRCAness phenotype. We explored the molecular changes in HGSC arising in association with specific BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic or germline mutations and in those with BRCA1 DNA promoter methylation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We describe gene expression and copy number analysis of two large cohorts of HGSC in which both germline and somatic inactivation of HRR has been measured. RESULTS: BRCA1 disruptions were associated with the C2 (immunoreactive) molecular subtype of HGSC, characterized by intense intratumoral T-cell infiltration. We derived and validated a predictor of BRCA1 mutation or methylation status, but could not distinguish BRCA2 from wild-type tumors. DNA copy number analysis showed that cases with BRCA1 mutation were significantly associated with amplification both at 8q24 (frequencies: BRCA1 tumors 50%, BRCA2 tumors 32%, and wild-type tumors 9%) and regions of the X-chromosome specifically dysregulated in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC; BRCA1 62%, BRCA2 34%, and wild-type 35%). Tumors associated with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations shared a negative association with amplification at 19p13 (BRCA1 0%, BRCA2 3%, and wild-type 20%) and 19q12 (BRCA1 6%, BRCA2 3%, and wild-type 29%). CONCLUSION: The molecular differences between tumors associated with BRCA1 compared with BRCA2 mutations are in accord with emerging clinical and pathologic data and support a growing appreciation of the relationship between HGSC and BLBC.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(BRCA1, LOF, High-gradeserousovariancancer), (BRCA2, LOF, High-gradeserousovariancancer)"}

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary arteriolar small-vessel disease caused by Notch3 mutations. A detailed definition of the neuro-ophthalmologic spectrum of CADASIL might provide new insights in the pathophysiology of small-vessel diseases. Therefore, this study aims to precisely delineate the features and the prevalence of the visual system impairment in CADASIL. METHODS: A cohort of 34 genetically confirmed CADASIL patients was enrolled in an observational cross-sectional study. Subjects underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmological evaluation. Clinical features and common cardiovascular risk factors were also considered. Data were compared with those already reported in previous studies. RESULTS: Both afferent and efferent visual structures were commonly impaired in CADASIL patients. Retinal microvascular changes such as arteriolar narrowing and arteriovenous nicking, described in most patients and detected also in asymptomatic carriers, reflect the typical hemodynamic changes of CADASIL. However, less frequent findings, like early macular and lens changes, would indicate a possible further role played by susceptibility to premature aging and degeneration. Cotton wool spots and vessel occlusions were not common. Finally, eye movement abnormalities suggest that the brainstem is particularly vulnerable to damage in CADASIL. CONCLUSIONS: Although no specific or prominent neuro-ophthalmologic finding can be considered as hallmark of the disease, afferent and efferent visual system abnormalities could be accounted as complementary markers to study cerebral small-vessel diseases.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(Notch3, GOF, Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)"}

PURPOSE: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare but potentially deadly tumor of the eye. Despite effective local therapies, recurrence and metastasis remain frequent. Once the tumor has metastasized, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor. To date, little is known of the genetic alterations in conjunctival melanomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted genetic analysis of 78 conjunctival melanomas, to our knowledge the largest cohort reported to date. An oncogene hotspot array was run on 38 samples, screening for a panel of known cancer-relevant mutations. Thirty tumors were analyzed for genome-wide copy number alterations (CNA) using array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Sanger sequencing of selected target mutations was conducted in all samples. RESULTS: BRAF mutations were identified in 23 of 78 (29%) tumors. NRAS mutations, previously not recognized as relevant in conjunctival melanoma, were detected in 14 of 78 (18%) tumors. We found CNAs affecting various chromosomes distributed across the genome in a pattern reminiscent of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma but differing markedly from uveal melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of NRAS or BRAF mutations in a mutually exclusive pattern in roughly half (47%) of conjunctival melanomas and the pattern of CNAs argue for conjunctival melanoma being closely related to cutaneous and mucosal melanoma but entirely distinct from uveal melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cocaine and opioid codependent (DSM-IV) patients were stabilized on methadone and subsequently randomized into treatment groups - disulfiram (250 mg/day, N=31) or placebo (N=37). They were genotyped for ANKK1 (rs1800497) and DRD2 (rs2283265) polymorphisms, and the data were evaluated for an association between a cocaine-free state, as assessed by cocaine-free urine samples, and disulfiram treatment.

RESULTS: Patients with CT or TT ANKK1 genotypes dropped from 80 to 52% cocaine-positive urines on disulfiram (N=13; P\ufffd\ufffd0.0001), whereas those on placebo (N=20) showed no treatment effect.

The most common mutations were R182H in JME patients (p = 0.010) and 3'UTR in the control group (p < 0.001). The R182H mutation is a common variant in JME (95 % CI: 1.232-76.580, p = 0.031) and the 3'UTR mutation may be associated with lower risk of JME in the Turkish population (95 % CI: 13.89-166.67, p < 0.001). \\n Significance: Our results indicate that EFHC1 gene variants carry a risk for JME and the 3'UTR variant may have a protective role against JME in the Turkish population. Screening for other genes is needed to further clarify the genetic inheritance of JME in Turkish patients.\\n Keywords: EFHC1; Genetic mutation; Juvenil myoclonic epilepsy.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(EFHC1, GOF, Juvenilemyoclonicepilepsy)"}

Constant research has updated the understanding of RB1-related pathways and their impact on tumor and nontumor diseases. Mutation of RB1 gene has been observed in multiple types of malignant tumors including prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and almost every familial and sporadic case of retinoblastoma. Even if well-known and long-investigated, the application potential of RB1 mutation has not been fully tapped. In this review, we focus on the mechanism underlying RB1 mutation during oncogenesis. Therapeutically, we have further discussed potential clinical strategies by targeting RB1-mutated cancers. The unsolved problems and prospects of RB1 mutation are also discussed.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(RB1, GOF, Retinoblastoma), (RB1, GOF, Prostatecancer), (RB1, GOF, Lungcancer), (RB1, GOF, Breastcancer)"}

Clinical, immunologic and radiographical examinations were performed, and 10 patients were empirically initiated on anticytokine therapy and monitored. Exome sequencing was used to identify a new pathogenic variant. Cytokine profiling, transcriptomics, immunoblotting and knock-in mice were used to assess the impact of ALPK1 mutations on protein function and immune signalling.\\n Results: The majority of the cohort carried the p.Thr237Met mutation but we also identified a new ROSAH-associated mutation, p.Tyr254Cys.Nearly all patients exhibited at least one feature consistent with inflammation including recurrent fever, headaches with meningeal enhancement and premature basal ganglia/brainstem mineralisation on MRI, deforming arthritis and AA amyloidosis. However, there was significant phenotypic variation, even within families and some adults lacked functional visual deficits. While anti-TNF and anti-IL-1 therapies suppressed systemic inflammation and improved quality of life, anti-IL-6 (tocilizumab) was the only anticytokine therapy that improved intraocular inflammation (two of two patients).Patients' primary samples and in vitro assays with mutated ALPK1 constructs showed immune activation with increased NF-\ufffd\ufffdB signalling, STAT1 phosphorylation and interferon gene expression signature. Knock-in mice with the Alpk1 T237M mutation exhibited subclinical inflammation.Clinical features not conventionally attributed to inflammation were also common in the cohort and included short dental roots, enamel defects and decreased salivary flow. \\n Conclusion: ROSAH syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease caused by gain-of-function mutations in ALPK1 and some features of disease are amenable to immunomodulatory therapy.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(ALPK1, GOF, ROSAHsyndrome)"}

In the final pre-specified analysis (64% maturity), median overall survival (OS) was 19.3 months for olaparib and 17.1 months for TPC (P = 0.513). Post-hoc extended follow-up, 25.7 months longer than previously reported for OS, is reported.\\n Patients and methods: Patients with gBRCAm, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative mBC, who had received   2 lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease, were randomised 2:1 to olaparib (300 mg bid) or TPC. During extended follow-up, OS was analysed every 6 months using the stratified log-rank test (overall population) and Cox proportional hazards model (pre-specified subgroups). \\n Results: In the overall population (302 patients; 76.8% maturity), median OS was 19.3 months for olaparib and 17.1 months for TPC (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.67-1.18); median follow-up was 18.9 and 15.5 months, respectively. Three-year survival was 27.9% for olaparib versus 21.2% for TPC. With olaparib, 8.8% of patients received study treatment for   3 years versus none with TPC. In first-line mBC, median OS was longer for olaparib than TPC (22.6 versus 14.7 months; hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.95) and 3-year survival was 40.8% for olaparib versus 12.8% for TPC. No new serious adverse events related to olaparib were observed.\\n Conclusions: OS was consistent with previous analyses from OlympiAD. These findings support the possibility of meaningful long-term survival benefit with olaparib, particularly in first-line mBC.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(BRCA, GOF, Metastaticbreastcancer)"}
